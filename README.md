# Movie & series application

This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb. The application is only made for educational purposes.

You can find the home page from here: [The movie database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

### Features

- List movies & series with many different filters
- Search for specific movies & series

  - Full cast and crew
  - Similar movies
  - ...

### Usage

The application needs a private API key (v3). You can get your own API key by registering to [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) site and placing it into .env file which allows you to store it into environment variables. I have provided a template env file which can be used to use the API key. Remember to rename and delete the .template ending after placing the key!
