### Usage

The application needs a private API key (v3). You can get your own API key by registering to [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) site and placing it into .env file which allows you to store it into environment variables. I have provided a template env file which can be used to use the API key. Remember to rename and delete the .template ending after placing the key!
